# zflate

The goal is to make these compression functions work exactly like in PHP

- gzdeflate()
- gzcompress()
- gzencode()

And decompression
- gzinflate()
- gzuncompress()
- gzdecode()

Also leaving possiblity to read big files by chunks easily

Unit must be as small as possible (compiled demo has only 78 kB)
